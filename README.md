# yaml
Digital guide to the YAML framework.
In 2005, the web developer Dirk Jesse published the responsive CSS framework YAML under the Creative Commons license CC-BY 2.0, which allowed the basic framework to be used for free both privately and commercially. Operators who want to put their web project online under a different license can also acquire a commercial model that gives them free access to the licensing. The focus of the CSS framework has always been on offering users the biggest possible freedom for the design of barrier-free web applications. The current version of the framework (4.2.1) was made available in 2013, and is supported by various content management systems such as WordPress, TYPO3, or Joomla thanks to corresponding CMS integration templates.
